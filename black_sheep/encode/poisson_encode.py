    Encodes the data into a tensor of Poisson spike trains.
    Formally, it is a function f: R -> {0, 1}‚Åø, where n is the spike_train_count for each data point.
    A 4x4 image would be encoded into a 16xN tensor: one spike train per pixel.
    Can be made deterministic by invoking torch.manual_seed before calling.
